## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**abstract-colors/abstract-colors** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-  Iâ€™m currently working on VST plugins, & an android music player app.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on bass music production & audio engineering in general.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about permaculture.
